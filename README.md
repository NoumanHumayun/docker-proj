## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a scalable ExpressJS application that allows users to post and comment on posts. This should be an individual project.
You may begin working on the project at any point however it is designed to be started during the final week.

## Instructions

Create a new branch for this project, branching from the main branch.

Create a REST API ExpressJS application that is connected to a MySQL database. Your application must contain unit and end to end tests for at least 2 routes.

### Endpoints

The application must expose the following endpoints:

#### Unauthenticated

- /users to fetch all users
- /login to return an authentication token for the user. (passwords should NOT be stored in plaintext)

#### Authenticated

The following endpoints all process data relevant to the sender's user id

##### Fetching Data

- GET /posts to fetch all posts by a sender
- GET /posts/:id to fetch a single post made by a sender
- GET /posts/:id/comments to fetch all comments about a post
- GET /posts/:id/comments?userId=2 to fetch all comments made by userId 2 about a specific post. ( this should be made generic and not specific to user2)

##### Adding Data

- POST /posts to create a new post
- POST /posts/:id/comments to add a new comment to a post

##### Updating Data

- PATCH /posts/:id to update a post
- PATCH /posts/:id/comments to update a comment

##### Deleting Data

- DELETE /posts/:id/comments to delete a comment
